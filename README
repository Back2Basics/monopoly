I'm creating this so parents and teachers have a way to explain What computer science is and how to do a computer science based experiment.  The speech to tell your kids is here-> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGhIcP2lCfL2PrsaNA64_LDXpfVm1yyVjfbaOY8Xp3k/edit?usp=sharing.
The code is freely available for you to try out different player scenarios.

*** NOTE: Right now it's not working for an entire game but I've got many of the mechanics worked out.


Stuff that is built in already:
Players currently have a percentage strategy built it (When considering a purchase, they buy 25% of the time by default)

* TODO:
* Crashes before it gets all the way through a game.  Got to fix that.
* collect info about winning strategies.  (properties/houses

** Cards:
I left off chance cards because I am going to be running 100's and 1000's of simulations and which player wins the beauty pagent isn't going to have a huge influence on the overall strategy of the game.  However I need to add them back in due to certain cards that take you someplace else on the board which changes the chances if you buy certain properties.

** House/Apartment limits:
I was going to allow for infinite houses.  Well it turns out that limitation is a strategy point... I'll put the limits back in.

** Bank Limit:
There is a limit on the amount of money on the board.  I am used to playing the FED rules (just print more).  I've never hit the limit but given the number of games I'm playing ... it could happen but... what do I do when that happens?

** Player Limit:
I need to put in one.

** mortgaged vs sold.
Currently I only support selling the properties but I would like to know if mortgaging the properties helps or hurts.
